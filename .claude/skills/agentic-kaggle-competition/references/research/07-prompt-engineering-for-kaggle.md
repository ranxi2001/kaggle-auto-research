# Prompt Engineering for Kaggle Delegation

> *How to write effective prompts when delegating work to AI agents during a competition.*

---## Compliance Note

Use these patterns only with competition-permitted data, code, models, notebooks, and external resources. Do not privately share competition code, data, predictions, prompts, logs, or results outside your Kaggle team. Do not tune directly against the public leaderboard through repeated submissions; use cross-validation and local holdout validation instead. Always check the specific competition rules before applying these workflows.



## When to Delegate vs Do It Yourself

| Task | Delegate? | Why |
|------|-----------|-----|
| Download data / check files | No | Faster to do directly |
| Metadata edits (kernel-metadata.json) | No | Mechanical, low risk |
| Fork & push existing kernel | No | One-line CLI command |
| Feature engineering | **Yes** | Agent can explore many transforms quickly |
| Model training & tuning | **Yes** | Agent can iterate on architecture/hyperparams |
| Ensemble construction | **Yes** | Agent can test many blend combinations |
| Debugging failing kernels | **Yes** | Agent can read logs and diagnose |
| Final submission decisions | **No** | Human judgment on risk/reward |

## The Delegation Prompt Framework

### Structure

Every delegation prompt should contain these elements:

1. **Context** — What competition are we in? What is the task?
2. **Data** — Where is the data? What does it look like?
3. **Goal** — What exactly should the agent produce?
4. **Constraints** — Time, memory, internet, GPU limits
5. **Success Criteria** — How will we know it worked?
6. **Forbidden Actions** — What must the agent NOT do?

### Template

```markdown
## Competition Context
- Task: [e.g., binary classification / object detection / forecasting]
- Metric: [e.g., AUC-ROC / F1 / RMSE]
- Submission format: [CSV / model weights / ONNX]

## Data
- Training data: /kaggle/input/<dataset>/train/ (describe structure)
- Test data: /kaggle/input/<dataset>/test/
- Sample submission: /kaggle/input/<dataset>/sample_submission.csv
- Key columns: [list]
- Size: [rows × columns]

## Goal
[Specific deliverable, e.g.: "Train a model and generate submission.csv"]

## Constraints
- Internet: [enabled / disabled]
- GPU: [available / not available]
- Time limit: [per-sample or per-batch]
- Memory: [if known]

## Success Criteria
- Must beat current score of [X]
- Must use [specific technique or constraint]

## Forbidden
- Do not use training data as fallback when test data is missing
- Do not hardcode file paths outside /kaggle/input/
- Do not assume test data has the same distribution as train
```

## Effective Prompt Patterns

### ✅ Good Prompt — Feature Engineering
```
I'm working on a tabular classification competition.
Training data: /kaggle/input/comp-data/train.csv (5000 rows, 30 features, target column "label")
Test data: /kaggle/input/comp-data/test.csv (2000 rows, same features, no label)

Create 10 new features using interactions, aggregations, and transforms.
- Check each new feature's correlation with the target
- Drop any feature with >0.95 correlation to an existing feature
- Save the enhanced dataset to /kaggle/working/enhanced_train.csv and /kaggle/working/enhanced_test.csv

Report: list each new feature and its correlation with target.
```

### ✅ Good Prompt — Model Training
```
Train a LightGBM classifier on /kaggle/working/enhanced_train.csv
Target: "label", features: all other columns
Constraints:
- 5-fold stratified CV
- Optimize for AUC-ROC
- Early stopping on fold 0
- Max 500 boosting rounds, patience 50
Report: mean CV score + std, feature importance top 10
Save model to /kaggle/working/model.txt
```

### ✅ Good Prompt — Debugging
```
My kernel at https://www.kaggle.com/code/username/kernel-name failed with error:
[paste error message]

The kernel:
1. Reads train/test data from /kaggle/input/...
2. Trains a model
3. Generates submission.csv

Diagnose the error and fix the code.
Do NOT change the model architecture — only fix the bug.
Push the updated kernel to the same path.
```

### ❌ Bad Prompt — Too Vague
```
Build a good model for my competition
```

### ❌ Bad Prompt — No Constraints
```
Train the best possible classifier. Use whatever you need.
```

### ❌ Bad Prompt — Missing Data Context
```
Make a submission for the competition. It should score well.
```

## Common Delegation Failures

| Failure | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Agent goes off-track | Prompt too vague | Add specific goal + success criteria |
| Agent uses forbidden internet | No constraint stated | Always state "internet disabled if applicable" |
| Agent ignores time limit | No time constraint | Specify "max X seconds per prediction" |
| Agent produces wrong format | No format example | Provide sample of expected output |
| Agent trains on test data | No data separation instruction | Explicitly say "train ONLY on train data" |
| Agent doesn't report results | No reporting instruction | Always ask "report: [specific metrics]" |

---

## Iteration Pattern

Delegation is rarely one-shot. Use this loop:

```
1. Delegate with clear prompt
2. Agent returns result + report
3. You verify locally (if possible)
4. If result is good → proceed
5. If result needs improvement → refine prompt with:
   - What was wrong
   - What to try differently
   - Updated constraints
6. Repeat until satisfied
```

## Multi-Agent Delegation

When using multiple subagents in parallel:

- **Give each agent a different angle** — e.g., one does feature engineering, another does hyperparameter tuning
- **Define clear interfaces** — each agent should output to a known file path
- **Assign a validator** — one agent checks the others' outputs before merging
- **Avoid conflicting writes** — never have two agents write to the same file

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Context is king** — The more relevant context you give, the better the result
2. **Constraints prevent disasters** — Always state what the agent must NOT do
3. **Show, don't just tell** — Include examples of expected input/output format
4. **Iterate** — First attempt rarely perfect; refine based on results
5. **Verify before trusting** — Always check agent output before submitting
